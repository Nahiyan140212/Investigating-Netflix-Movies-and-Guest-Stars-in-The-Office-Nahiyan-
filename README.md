# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office-Nahiyan-
Python projects on DataCamp

Apply the foundational skills in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to manipulate and visualize movie and TV data.


In these projects, I’ll apply the skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. I’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

This project is a datacamp career track project


Guided project
Dig into a real-world Netflix movie dataset using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

Project tasks
Loading a friend's data into a dictionary
Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
A visual inspection of our data
Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
Filtering for movies!
Creating a scatter plot
Digging deeper
Marking non-feature films
Plotting with color!
What next?


Unguided project
Project task
Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:
Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis
Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis
A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:
Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"
Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"
Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"
Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"
A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25
A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"
An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"
A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"
Provide the name of one of the guest stars (hint, there were multiple!) who was in the most watched Office episode.
